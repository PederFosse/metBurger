                    MetBurger was founded in 2020 by two students at osloMet.
                    Their names are Fredrik and Peder, they have been making
                    hamburgers since they were very young and decided that they
                    wanted to fulfill their life long dream - selling hamburgers.

                <p class="about-element">
                    MetBurger has only one restaurant yet, located at bislettgata123.
                    We are however expanding rapidly and will by april 2021 have two new
                    restaurants in oslo, one located at majorstua and one at jerbanetorget.
